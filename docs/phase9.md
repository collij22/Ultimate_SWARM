I’m going to create Phase 9 scaffolding: new schemas, validators, knowledge indexer/retriever, evaluator, spend aggregator, update policies and CLI commands, and then ensure no linter errors.

[1 tool called]

I'll first inspect `package.json` and `orchestration/cli.mjs` to integrate new modules and ensure required dependencies (e.g., ajv) are present, then proceed to add the schemas and modules.

I’m going to open `orchestration/cli.mjs` to understand how to add new subcommands cleanly, then create the Phase 9 schema files in parallel.

I’m about to add the validator and knowledge/spend modules, update CLI commands, and enforce agent budgets in the router, then run lint checks.

[1 tool called]

I created the Phase 9 JSON Schemas and will now implement the validator, knowledge indexer/retriever, evaluator, spend aggregator, update policies and router, and extend the CLI. After each set of edits, I’ll check for linter issues and fix them.

I'll add the new CLI subcommand for Phase 9 agent-output validation and run the linter on the new validator module.

I'll add the knowledge indexer/retriever, evaluator, spend aggregator, update router to enforce per-agent budgets, update policies with budget stubs, extend the CLI with knowledge/agents/observability commands, and seed minimal knowledge assets. Then I’ll lint the changed files.

- I added Phase 9 core scaffolding: schemas, validator + CLI, knowledge indexer/retriever, evaluator, spend aggregator, router budget enforcement, and CLI extensions; lints are clean.

- Files added/updated
  - schemas: `agent-output.schema.json`, `agent-escalation.schema.json`, `agent-changeset.schema.json`, `agent-scorecard.schema.json`
  - orchestration/lib: `agent_output_validator.mjs`, `knowledge_indexer.mjs`, `knowledge_retriever.mjs`
  - orchestration/agents: `evaluator.mjs`
  - orchestration/observability: `spend_aggregator.mjs`
  - orchestration/cli.mjs: new commands `validate agent-output`, `knowledge build-index`, `agents score --agent <ID>`, `observability spend`
  - mcp: `policies.yaml` (agents.budgets), `router.mjs` (per-agent/ per-capability budget enforcement)

- How to use
  - Validate agent outputs:
    - node orchestration/cli.mjs validate agent-output runs/agents/<agent>/<run>/result-cards/agent-output.json
  - Build knowledge index:
    - node orchestration/cli.mjs knowledge build-index
  - Score an agent on synthetic tasks:
    - node orchestration/cli.mjs agents score --agent B7.rapid_builder
  - Aggregate spend:
    - node orchestration/cli.mjs observability spend

- Next steps (optional)
  - Seed `.claude/knowledge/**` with curated exemplars and add `tests/agents/synthetic/**` tasks.
  - Add `.claude/agents/OUTPUT_STANDARDS.md`, `EVALUATION.md`, `RETRIEVAL.md`.
  - Wire CI: validate agent outputs, build knowledge index, run fast-tier synthetic tasks, aggregate spend.

- Commit suggestion
  - feat(phase9): add agent schemas, validator, knowledge index, evaluator, spend dashboards, and CLI cmds

  ***

  I'll add synthetic tasks and fixtures, author the agent docs, seed knowledge assets, then run lint checks and close the remaining TODOs.

I'm going to add the remaining docs and seed knowledge assets, then run lint checks and close the outstanding TODOs.

[4 tools called]

- Completed outstanding items: added synthetic task + fixtures, authored `.claude/agents` docs, seeded knowledge, extended CLI, and ran lint checks.

- You can now:
  - Build knowledge index:
    - node orchestration/cli.mjs knowledge build-index
  - Validate agent output:
    - node orchestration/cli.mjs validate agent-output tests/agents/fixtures/agent-output-valid.json
  - Score an agent:
    - node orchestration/cli.mjs agents score --agent B7.rapid_builder
  - Aggregate spend:
    - node orchestration/cli.mjs observability spend

- Added files of note
  - tests: `tests/agents/fixtures/agent-output-valid.json`, `tests/agents/synthetic/agent-output-schema-basic.yaml`
  - docs: `.claude/agents/OUTPUT_STANDARDS.md`, `.claude/agents/EVALUATION.md`, `.claude/agents/RETRIEVAL.md`

- All Phase 9 TODOs are checked off.
