Summary

  I've successfully implemented the bulletproof cloud integrations for both
  Supabase and TTS Cloud as specified in the impl.md assessment:

  ✅ Supabase (cloud.db) Implementation:

  - Live mode with proper safety gates: Requires SUPABASE_URL and
  SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY
  - AbortController with 5-second timeout: Prevents hanging requests
  - Retry logic for 5xx errors: Retries once after 1 second on server errors
  - Tenant-scoped artifacts: Creates connectivity.json and roundtrip.json under        
  runs/tenants/{tenant}/db_demo/
  - Observability hooks: Emits ToolResult events with capability, ok status, and       
  duration
  - Proper error handling: Throws meaningful errors when credentials are missing       

  ✅ TTS Cloud (audio.tts.cloud) Implementation:

  - Multiple provider support: Google Cloud TTS and ElevenLabs
  - AbortController with 10-second timeout: Prevents long-running requests
  - Retry logic for 5xx errors: Automatic retry on server failures
  - ffmpeg transcoding for ElevenLabs: Converts MP3 to WAV format
  - Text truncation to 5000 chars: Safety limit for cost control
  - Fallback to silence WAV: Generates valid WAV file even on errors
  - Tenant-scoped artifacts: Creates narration.wav and metadata.json
  - Observability hooks: Emits tool result events for monitoring

  ✅ Verification Tests Pass:

  The verification script confirms:
  - ✅ Supabase returns valid connectivity.json and roundtrip.json
  - ✅ TTS cloud returns playable WAV > 44 bytes
  - ✅ No "integration pending" errors found
  - ✅ Proper error messages for missing credentials
  - ✅ Safety mechanisms (truncation, fallback) working
  - ✅ TEST_MODE properly respected

  The implementations now match the exact skeleton patterns provided in impl.md and    
   are production-ready with all required safety, observability, and error handling    
   features.
