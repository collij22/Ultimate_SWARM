Issues Found with the Other Agent's Implementation

  After scrutinizing the changes made by the other agent, I've identified several
  critical issues:

  1. AUV-0002 UI Test File Missing - CRITICAL

  - Problem: The UI test file tests/robot/playwright/auv-0002-ui.spec.ts specified    
   in capabilities/AUV-0002.yaml line 42 does not exist
  - Impact: When the autopilot runs, the ensureTests() function will try to
  generate this file, but:
    - The existing products.spec.ts file already captures both screenshots (lines     
  25-26)
    - This creates a conflict where two different test files try to create the        
  same artifacts
  - Root Cause: The other agent claimed to have updated this in their change list     
  but didn't actually create the file

  2. Screenshot Capture Logic Flaw

  - Problem: In products.spec.ts, the screenshots are taken AFTER navigation:
  await cards.first().click();  // Navigate to detail
  await page.screenshot({ path: path.join(dir, 'products_grid.png') });  // Wrong!    
   This captures detail page
  await page.screenshot({ path: path.join(dir, 'product_detail.png') });  // Both     
  are detail page
  - Impact: Both screenshots will show the detail page, not the grid
  - Fix Needed: Must capture products_grid.png BEFORE clicking to navigate

  3. Graph Parallelization Test Issues

  The other agent's changes have several problems:

  a. Different from my implementation:
  - Other agent uses WORK_DURATION_MS = isCI ? 1000 : 400 (1000ms CI, 400ms local)    
  - I used isCI ? 300 : 200 in my fix
  - The other agent removed the server node entirely (good)
  - Uses sweep-line algorithm for max concurrency (more complex than needed)

  b. Potential Issue: The sweep-line algorithm at lines 187-192 has a subtle bug:     
  events.sort((a, b) => a.t - b.t || b.d - a.d); // start before end at same t        
     The comment says "start before end" but b.d - a.d sorts end events (-1)
  before start events (1) when times are equal, which is backwards.

  4. Test Authoring Detail Test Generation

  - Good: The test authoring enhancement (lines 131-145 in test_authoring.mjs)        
  correctly generates a detail test
  - Issue: The generated test doesn't navigate back to the grid before taking the     
  grid screenshot

  5. Expected Artifacts Resolution

  - Good: The YAML-first approach in expected_artifacts.mjs is correct
  - Verified: This will properly use the artifacts defined in
  capabilities/AUV-0002.yaml

  Summary of Critical Issues:

  1. Missing test file that's referenced in capability YAML
  2. Wrong screenshot timing - both screenshots capture detail page
  3. Sweep-line sort order bug in parallelization test (minor)
  4. The other agent claimed to make changes that weren't actually implemented        

  The most critical issue is that the CVF will still fail because:
  - The auv-0002-ui.spec.ts file doesn't exist but is referenced
  - The existing products.spec.ts takes screenshots at the wrong time
  - When ensureTests() runs with FORCE_REGEN=1, it will create a new test file        
  that conflicts with the existing one
