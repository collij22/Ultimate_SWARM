Phase 1 Critical Fix Applied ✅

  🐛 Issue Found

  AUV-0002 runbook was configured to run the wrong test specs:
  - Was running: add-to-cart.spec.ts and api/cart.spec.ts (cart functionality tests)
  - Should run: products.spec.ts and api/products.spec.ts (product listing/detail tests)

  This mismatch caused CVF to fail because the required artifacts weren't being generated.

  🔧 Fix Applied

  Updated orchestration/runbooks/auv_delivery.mjs:
  'AUV-0002': {
    specs: [
      'tests/robot/playwright/products.spec.ts',      // Generates UI screenshots
      'tests/robot/playwright/api/products.spec.ts',  // Generates API JSON artifacts
    ],
    // ... rest unchanged
  }

  ✅ Verification

  The corrected specs now produce exactly what CVF expects for AUV-0002:
  - runs/AUV-0002/api/get_products_200.json ✓
  - runs/AUV-0002/ui/products_grid.png ✓
  - runs/AUV-0002/ui/product_detail.png ✓
  - runs/AUV-0002/perf/lighthouse.json ✓
