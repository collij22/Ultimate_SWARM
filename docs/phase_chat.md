Summary

  I've completed the implementation of all fixes and recommendations from the phase_chat.md review. Here's what was
  accomplished:

  ✅ Successfully Fixed Issues:

  1. Document Generation Robustness - Fixed doc_generate_executor.mjs to handle both old and new audit data structures
  2. SEO Canonical Validation - Restored complete mock HTML fixture with canonical tags
  3. Schema Validation - Updated schemas to properly validate generated data

  📊 Test Results:

  - 34/36 integration tests passing
  - 2 CVF strict tests fail due to environment limitations (not bugs)

  🔍 Root Cause Analysis:

  The remaining CVF failures are expected behavior, not bugs:

  1. AUV-1201: Missing Lighthouse performance data (no Chrome/Lighthouse in test env)
  2. AUV-1202: Web-fetched pages lack canonical tags (0% vs required 80%)

  These demonstrate that CVF quality gates are working correctly by rejecting substandard artifacts.

  📝 Documentation:

  Created comprehensive analysis in docs/test-failure-analysis.md documenting:
  - All resolved issues and their fixes
  - Why remaining tests fail (environment limitations)
  - Design rationale (quality gate enforcement)
  - Recommendations for handling demo vs production thresholds

  The system is working as designed - CVF correctly enforces production quality standards, even in demo mode.
