I reviewed the code to verify each claimed fix; here’s what’s truly done vs still missing before we call Phase 7 complete.

_Confirmed implemented correctly_
-AUV-0002 artifacts updated to products_grid.png, product_detail.png + perf in orchestration/lib/expected_artifacts.mjs.

-Manifest mapping reads duration_ms and perf.perf_score in orchestration/package.mjs.

-Report copies large screenshots to dist/<AUV>/assets/ and embeds small ones; report renders offline.

-CLI now prints bundle.zip_path and bundle.bytes.

-Run ID is generated when absent.

-Packaging bundles generated verify-docs via tracked generatedFiles.

_Claims not reflected in code (must fix now)_
-Budget status mapping: still uses budgetEval.status || 'unknown'; compute from budgetEval.passed ? 'pass' : 'fail'.

-Screenshot asset collisions: copies to assets/<basename>.png only; preserve subpaths (e.g., assets/runs/AUV-0002/ui/products_grid.png).

-deliverable.version: remains 1.0.0-<auv-id>; fails schema if pre-release contains hyphen. Use e.g., 1.0.0-auv.0005 (replace hyphens inside the tag with dots).

-Schema artifact path regex: schemas/manifest.schema.json still has a pattern that forbids dots ("^[^\\.\\.]+$"). Replace with a traversal-safe pattern that allows dots/slashes, e.g., ^(?!.*\.\.)[\w\-\/\.]+$.

-Report manifest JSON escaping: {{manifest_json}} is injected unescaped; escape it (or render via JS using textContent) to prevent HTML injection in the pre block.

-Docs drift: docs/ORCHESTRATION.md still references AUV-XXXX_bundle.zip; change to package.zip.

-Drift test not removed: tests/robot/playwright/auv-0002-ui.spec.ts still exists (uses products_search.png).

-Unit tests AUV IDs: tests/unit/package.test.mjs still uses TEST-0001 and sets zip_path under dist/TEST-0001, which violates the schema pattern ^dist/AUV-\d{4}/package\.zip$. Update to valid AUV-9999 etc.

-“Added expected artifacts for test AUVs”: no such additions found in expected_artifacts.mjs or capabilities; tests shouldn’t assume missing artifacts.

_Go/no‑go_
-After applying the above fixes (budget status, path preservation, semver tag, schema regex, manifest JSON escaping, docs/test alignments), Phase 7 packaging/report will meet the plan’s deliverables and acceptance.
-Quick acceptance checks:
-Package + validate: run AUV (e.g., AUV-0005), then node orchestration/cli.mjs package AUV-0005 and validate manifest with Ajv.
-Report: node orchestration/cli.mjs report AUV-0005; open dist/AUV-0005/report.html; screenshots must render offline from assets/ with preserved subpaths.
-Tests: update unit tests to valid AUV IDs; ensure all tests pass locally
