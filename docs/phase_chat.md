## Phase 4 â€” Remaining Enhancements To Implement (Guidance)

Must fix before Phase 5
-Runbook RouterPreview timestamp:
  -Currently emits ISO string (ts: new Date().toISOString()). Switch to epoch seconds (ts: Date.now()/1000) for consistency with other emitters.

-Make schema validation testable:
  -Add failing-config tests that call loadConfig() and assert Ajv throws with clear messages (e.g., missing required fields, wrong types). Right now tests use parsed YAML directly and donâ€™t exercise validation failures.

-Ensure new router tests run in CI:
  -tests/router.test.mjs is not under tests/unit and doesnâ€™t use node:test, so it wonâ€™t run via npm run test:unit. Either:
    -Move it to tests/unit/router_phase4.test.mjs and use node:test, or
    -Add a script test:router and wire it into CI.

-Document and exercise api_key_env:
  -Add an example in mcp/registry.yaml (e.g., vercel.api_key_env: VERCEL_TOKEN) and a test asserting the override works.

Nice-to-have (recommended)
-Graph runner: also append a small RouterPreview event to runs/observability/hooks.jsonl for parity with runbook.
-Align counts/claims in mcp/README.md with actual registry size, or expand registry to match.

Go/No-Go
With the timestamp fix, schema-failure tests added, and test integration corrected, Phase 4 is production-solid and we can proceed to Phase 5 (enforcement in the build lane).

Further details on how to implement below, must be used as a basis for the changes:
----

### Must-implement now

1) CI wiring for router tests
- Add a dedicated script and run it in CI.
```json
// package.json (scripts)
"test:router": "node tests/router.test.mjs"
```
- CI: add a step after unit tests: `npm run test:router`.

2) Graph runner hooks + ledger for router preview
- File: `orchestration/graph/runner.mjs`
- After writing `router_preview_<node_type>.json`, also:
  - Append a hooks event (epoch seconds):
```js
emitEvent({ type: 'RouterPreview', auv_id: AUV_ID, node_type: node.type, tool_count: routerResult.toolPlan.length, total_cost_usd: routerResult.budget });
```
  - Update spend ledger (reuse `updateLedger` from `mcp/router.mjs`):
```js
const { updateLedger } = await import('../../mcp/router.mjs');
updateLedger(process.env.SESSION_ID || this.runId, routerResult.toolPlan);
```

3) Derive router capabilities from AUV spec (not hard-coded)
- Files: `orchestration/runbooks/auv_delivery.mjs`, `orchestration/graph/runner.mjs`.
- Strategy:
  - Load `capabilities/<AUV-ID>.yaml`.
  - If `authoring_hints.ui.page` â†’ include `browser.automation`.
  - If page exists â†’ include `web.perf_audit`.
  - If `authoring_hints.api` present â†’ include `api.test`.
  - Map other hints (e.g., visual) â†’ `visual.regression` as needed.
```js
const hints = cap.authoring_hints || {};
const caps = new Set();
if (hints.ui?.page) caps.add('browser.automation') || caps.add('web.perf_audit');
if (hints.api) caps.add('api.test');
// TODO: extend mapping as policies evolve
const requestedCapabilities = [...caps];
```

4) Cross-reference validation (policies â†” registry)
- File: `mcp/router.mjs` (inside `loadConfig()` after Ajv checks).
- Add referential integrity checks and throw clear errors:
```js
// capability_map tools must exist
for (const [cap, tools] of Object.entries(policies.capability_map)) {
  for (const id of tools) {
    if (!registry.tools[id]) throw new Error(`capability_map references unknown tool: ${id} (capability=${cap})`);
  }
}
// optional: warn if registry tool is unmapped or capability not covered
```

5) Safety enforcement in router decisions
- File: `mcp/router.mjs` (inside `planTools`).
- Enforce `policies.safety`:
  - If `allow_production_mutations:false` and `NODE_ENV==='production'`, reject tools with `side_effects` including `exec` or external `network` unless an explicit override flag is set (e.g., `SAFETY_ALLOW_PROD=true`).
  - If `require_test_mode_for` contains domains like `payments`, require `TEST_MODE==='true'` or reject with rationale.
```js
const isProd = (env.NODE_ENV === 'production');
if (isProd && policies.safety?.allow_production_mutations === false) {
  const risky = (tool.side_effects || []).some(e => e === 'exec' || e === 'network');
  if (risky && env.SAFETY_ALLOW_PROD !== 'true') {
    decision.rejected.push({ tool_id: toolId, reason: 'blocked by safety policy in production', capability });
    continue;
  }
}
```

6) CLI enhancements for operability
- File: `mcp/router.mjs`
- Add `--session <ID>` to set ledger session; default remains UUID.
- Add `--validate` mode to only load+validate configs and exit non-zero on errors.
```js
// parse --session, --validate; pass session to updateLedger; if --validate, run loadConfig() and exit(0/1)
```

### Nice-to-haves (implement now)

7) Enriched decision rationale & alternatives
- File: `mcp/router.mjs`
- For each capability, record `alternatives[]` with `{ tool_id, tier, reason }` for rejected candidates; include in decision JSON under `decision.alternatives` to aid debugging and policy tuning.

8) Router coverage report
- New file: `mcp/router-report.mjs`
- Emits JSON to `runs/router/report.json` with:
  - Capabilities with no primary tools
  - Registry tools not referenced by any `capability_map`
  - Agents with empty/overly restrictive allowlists
```bash
node mcp/router-report.mjs
```

9) Policy docs generator
- New file: `mcp/generate-policy-doc.mjs`
- Produce `docs/MCP-POLICY.md` from `policies.yaml`/`registry.yaml`: tables for capabilitiesâ†’tools, tiers, budgets, allowlists.

10) Decision caching within process
- File: `mcp/router.mjs`
- Memoize `planTools` by key `{agentId, capabilities, budget, consent}` during a single process run to avoid recomputation; still write artifacts for the first call.

11) Secondary consent env handling in previews
- Files: `orchestration/runbooks/auv_delivery.mjs`, `orchestration/graph/runner.mjs`
- If `SECONDARY_CONSENT==='true'`, pass `secondaryConsent:true` to `planTools` for previews.

12) CI: fail fast on router validation errors
- Add a CI step: `node mcp/router.mjs --validate` before executing test suites.

---

### Acceptance checklist for these enhancements
- Router/graph previews emit hooks + ledger entries consistently with epoch timestamps.
- Router derives capabilities from AUV spec and passes schema + cross-ref validation.
- Safety policies actively block risky tools in production envs unless explicitly overridden.
- CI runs `test:unit`, `test:router`, and `router --validate`; fails on any error.
- Policy coverage report and generated docs are created without errors and kept up to date.
