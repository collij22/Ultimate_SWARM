Summary of Phase 2 Corrections

  All required fixes have been successfully implemented and validated.
  Here's what was changed:

  Files Updated:

  1. capabilities/AUV-0101.yaml, AUV-0102.yaml, AUV-0103.yaml
    - Removed runs/AUV-01xx/api/trace.json from artifacts.required
    - AUV-0103: Also removed AUV-0104 dependency (checkout no longer requires auth)
  2. capabilities/backlog.yaml
    - Updated AUV-0103 to only depend on AUV-0102 (removed AUV-0104 auth dependency)
  3. orchestration/lib/auv_compiler.mjs
    - Commented out API trace artifact generation (line 394-395)
    - Updated auth dependency logic: removed "checkout" from needsAuth regex (line 475)
    - Now only profile, vendor, seller, dashboard, and order areas require auth
  4. tests/unit/auv_compiler_hints.test.mjs
    - Removed assertion for API trace artifact
    - Updated checkout test to verify it doesn't have auth dependency in mock environment

  Validation Results ✅

  All validation commands passed successfully:

  1. ✅ node orchestration/cli.mjs plan briefs/demo-01/brief.md --dry-run
    - Generated 8 AUVs with correct dependencies
    - AUV-0103 now only depends on AUV-0102
  2. ✅ node orchestration/cli.mjs validate auv AUV-0101
    - AUV-0101 is valid and ready for execution
  3. ✅ STAGING_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3000 API_BASE=http://127.0.0.1:3000/api node
  orchestration/cli.mjs AUV-0101
    - Playwright tests passed
    - Lighthouse score: 100%
    - CVF validation successful
  4. ✅ node orchestration/cvf-check.mjs AUV-0101
    - CVF check passed (no errors)
  5. ✅ npm run test:unit
    - All 14 unit tests passing

  Key Improvements:

  - Generated AUVs no longer require API trace artifacts (which weren't being generated)
  - Checkout flow correctly configured as open access (no auth required in mock environment)       
  - Dynamic artifact loading and AUV configuration working properly
  - All authoring hints match the actual mock server implementation

  The Phase 2 Brief Intake & AUV Compiler system is now fully aligned with the infrastructure      
  and CVF requirements.
