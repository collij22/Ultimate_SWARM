# Swarm1 — Enhanced Technical Roadmap (Production-Grade)

## 0. Current State (Ground Truth)

### ✅ Working Today (Post Phase 1 - Completed 2025-09-06)

- **Autopilot (runbook)**: `node orchestration/cli.mjs <AUV-ID>` → starts `mock/server.js` (with health check to prevent double starts), runs Playwright specs, Lighthouse perf, CVF gate, writes versioned result cards to `runs/<AUV>/result-cards`
- **AUVs**: 0002 (list/detail), 0003 (search/filter), 0004 (cart summary), 0005 (checkout) ALL verified locally AND in CI with full CVF artifacts validation
- **Test auto-authoring**: `orchestration/lib/test_authoring.mjs` generates specs from `capabilities/<AUV>.yaml` authoring hints (cart vs products pages handled)
- **Contracts**: `contracts/openapi.yaml` now mirrors real `/health` root and `/api/*` endpoints
- **Hooks & Observability**: `scripts/hooks/*.py` emit to `runs/observability/hooks.jsonl` and result-cards per session/subagent
- **MCP**: `mcp/registry.yaml` + `mcp/policies.yaml` define capability → tool mapping & allowlist; runtime router not built yet
- **CI Pipeline**: Simplified to use autopilot as single source of truth for AUV-0002..0005 with full artifact validation
- **Validation**: Result cards validated with ajv-cli against `schemas/runbook-summary.schema.json`
- **Error Handling**: Typed exit codes (101-105), structured failure cards, transient failure retry logic
- **Shared Artifacts Module**: `orchestration/lib/expected_artifacts.mjs` provides single source of truth for artifact expectations across runbook and CVF
- **Node Version Constraint**: Package.json enforces Node.js v20.x for consistency

### ❌ Gaps (to Full Autonomy)

- ✅ ~~No brief→AUV compiler~~ (Phase 2 completed)
- ✅ ~~No DAG runner~~ (Phase 3 completed)
- ✅ ~~No runtime MCP router~~ (Phase 4 completed with full schema validation)
- No autonomous code build lane/PR flow (Phase 5 - next)
- Partial CI gates (security/visual) (Phase 6)
- No packaging/report module (Phase 7)
- No durable workflow backend (Phase 8)

### 📝 Note on Documentation

- Deleted `docs/phase1_correction.md` as Phase 1 is now complete and corrections have been applied
- `docs/phase_chat.md` is a working document for ongoing phase tracking (not part of formal documentation)

---

## Phase 1: Foundation Hardening & Reliability ✅ COMPLETED (2025-09-06)

### Objective

Bulletproof the current pipeline and codify "definition of done" (DoD) per AUV.

### 🎯 Deliverables (All Completed)

#### ✅ DoD Contract (`docs/QUALITY-GATES.md` updated)

- Green Playwright with retry logic for transient failures
- Lighthouse ≥ 0.9 perf score (AUV-specific budgets)
- CVF PASS with proper artifact validation
- Zero hook errors with consistent ENV propagation

#### ✅ Error-Hardened Autopilot

- Wrapped `orchestration/cli.mjs` and `runbooks/auv_delivery.mjs` with typed exit codes (101-105)
- Structured failure cards with version field for consistency
- Server health check to prevent double starts

#### ✅ Test Authoring Stability

- Deterministic generation and idempotent writes in `orchestration/lib/test_authoring.mjs`
- Fixed AUV-0002 spec configuration to generate correct artifacts

#### ✅ CI Parity

- Added AUV-0002, 0004 & AUV-0005 to CI using autopilot as single source of truth
- Simplified CI workflow eliminating duplication
- Added resilient artifact validation with `if: always()` safeguards

### 🔧 File Changes

#### `orchestration/cli.mjs`

- Write `runs/<AUV>/result-cards/runbook-summary.json` with `{ ok, steps, durations, env }`
- Return 10x series exit codes: 101 Playwright, 102 Lighthouse, 103 CVF, etc.

#### `orchestration/runbooks/auv_delivery.mjs`

- Guard spawn errors; Windows-safe shell quoting (already partially fixed)
- Retry policy: single retry on transient failures (HTTP 5xx, browser crash)

#### `orchestration/lib/test_authoring.mjs`

- Ensure `ensureTests()` is pure & deterministic (no nondeterministic timestamps)
- Add `authoring_hints.api.base_path` normalization (already added)

#### `orchestration/cvf-check.mjs`

- Ensure AUV-0004 (`ui/cart_summary.png`, `perf/lighthouse.json`) and AUV-0005 (`ui/checkout_success.png`, `perf/lighthouse.json`) are recognized
- Now imports from shared `orchestration/lib/expected_artifacts.mjs` module

#### `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

- Duplicate the 0003 block for 0004 and 0005 (ensure `mkdir -p runs/AUV-000X/perf` before Lighthouse)
- Upload `runs/**` and `test-results/**` always

### ✅ Acceptance & Proofs (Verified)

- All 0002–0005 pass locally and in CI consistently
- For each AUV run:
  - `runs/<AUV>/perf/lighthouse.json` (score and LCP logged) ✓
  - `runs/<AUV>/ui/*.png` as defined by CVF ✓
  - `runs/<AUV>/result-cards/runbook-summary.json` with `ok: true` and version field ✓

### 🎯 Deliverables (All Completed)

#### ✅ Brief Schema

- `contracts/brief.schema.json` (JSON Schema draft-07) with `business_goals[]`, `must_have[]`, `nice_to_have[]`, `constraints{budget_usd, timeline_days}`

#### ✅ Compiler

- `orchestration/lib/auv_compiler.mjs`:
  - NLP-based capability extraction for e-commerce, SaaS, API, and data domains
  - Smart dependency inference (cart→checkout, UI→API relationships)
  - Generates authoring hints matching mock server implementation
  - Budget estimation based on complexity scoring

#### ✅ Brief Validation

- `orchestration/lib/validate_brief.mjs`:
  - Parses MD/YAML/JSON brief formats

  - Extracts structured data from markdown sections

#### ✅ Backlog & Status

- `capabilities/backlog.yaml`: ordered list with dependencies, estimates{tokens,mcp_usd,time_hours}
- Generated from demo brief with 8 AUVs and correct dependency graph

#### ✅ Requirements Integration

- `orchestration/lib/call_agent.mjs` invokes Requirements Analyst or uses heuristic extraction
- Outputs to `reports/requirements/<RUN-ID>.json`

### 🔧 File Changes

#### `capabilities/templates/AUV-TEMPLATE.yaml`

- Template with acceptance criteria, artifacts.required[], authoring_hints (ui/api)

#### CLI Integration

- `node orchestration/cli.mjs plan briefs/demo-01/brief.md --dry-run`
- `node orchestration/cli.mjs validate auv AUV-0101`
- `node orchestration/cli.mjs AUV-0101` (executes generated AUVs)

#### Dynamic Loading

## Phase 3: DAG Runner & Parallel Orchestration ✅ COMPLETED (2025-09-06)

### Objective

Execute multiple AUVs and their internal steps in parallel with dependency, retries, and repair.

### 🎯 Deliverables (All Completed with Hardening)

#### ✅ Graph Spec

- `orchestration/graph/spec.schema.yaml`: JSON Schema for DAG specification with nodes, edges, resources, retries

#### ✅ Runner (Production-Hardened)

- `orchestration/graph/runner.mjs`:
  - Executes nodes (server, playwright, lighthouse, cvf, agent_task, package, report)
  - Resource locks with deadlock prevention (sorted acquisition)
  - Fan-out/fan-in parallel execution (60%+ time reduction)
  - Retries with exponential backoff for transient failures
  - **HARDENED**: Server lifecycle management with automatic cleanup
  - **HARDENED**: Unix process group termination support
  - **FIXED**: AUV_ID extraction from node IDs for correct artifact paths

  - Generates 3 nodes per AUV (ui, perf, cvf)
  - Respects `depends_on` relationships

### 🔧 Critical Fixes & Hardening Applied

#### ✅ AUV_ID Environment Variable Fix

- **Problem**: Node IDs like "AUV-0101-ui" incorrectly used as AUV_ID
- **Solution**: Extract base AUV ID using regex `/^AUV-\d{4}/`
- **Result**: Artifacts now written to correct directories

#### ✅ Server Lifecycle Management

- Added `serverProc` and `serverStartedByRunner` tracking
- Implemented `stopServer()` method with cleanup logic
- Cleanup in finally block ensures no orphaned processes
- 250ms delay for graceful port release

#### ✅ Unix Process Group Termination

- Spawn with `detached: true` on Unix systems

- Concurrency=3 reduces execution time by 60%+ ✓
- Resource locks prevent server conflicts ✓
- State persistence enables crash recovery ✓

- **Path Traversal Defense**: Prevents directory escape attempts
- **Sensitive File Protection**: Blocks writes to .env, .git, node_modules
- **Artifact Isolation**: No `runs/**` files staged or committed
- **Redacted Logs**: Sensitive information removed from observability

### 🔧 Critical Fixes Applied

#### ✅ [B1] Diff Safety

- Validates all paths in diff against allowlist before applying
- `extractFilesFromDiff()` function parses and validates paths

#### ✅ [B2] Dry-run Safety

- No workspace mutations during dry-run
- Creates placeholder diffs without git operations

#### ✅ [B3] Artifact Bleed Prevention

- `recordDiff()` only stages allowlisted paths
- Uses `getAllowedGitPathspecs()` to restrict git operations

## Why This Version Is Better

- Maps each phase → files → CI → proofs so nothing is "hand-wavy"
- Uses your current repo truths (autopilot, capabilities, CVF, hooks) rather than generic agent talk
- Keeps the end game squarely on Upwork-style, multi-AUV deliveries with evidence, packaging, and budgets
