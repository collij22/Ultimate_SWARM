# Swarm1 ‚Äî Enhanced Technical Roadmap (Production-Grade)

## 0. Current State (Ground Truth)

### ‚úÖ Working Today (Post Phase 1 - Completed 2025-09-06)

- **Autopilot (runbook)**: `node orchestration/cli.mjs <AUV-ID>` ‚Üí starts `mock/server.js` (with health check to prevent double starts), runs Playwright specs, Lighthouse perf, CVF gate, writes versioned result cards to `runs/<AUV>/result-cards`
- **AUVs**: 0002 (list/detail), 0003 (search/filter), 0004 (cart summary), 0005 (checkout) ALL verified locally AND in CI with full CVF artifacts validation
- **Test auto-authoring**: `orchestration/lib/test_authoring.mjs` generates specs from `capabilities/<AUV>.yaml` authoring hints (cart vs products pages handled)
- **Contracts**: `contracts/openapi.yaml` now mirrors real `/health` root and `/api/*` endpoints
- **Hooks & Observability**: `scripts/hooks/*.py` emit to `runs/observability/hooks.jsonl` and result-cards per session/subagent
- **MCP**: `mcp/registry.yaml` + `mcp/policies.yaml` define capability ‚Üí tool mapping & allowlist; runtime router not built yet
- **CI Pipeline**: Simplified to use autopilot as single source of truth for AUV-0002..0005 with full artifact validation
- **Validation**: Result cards validated with ajv-cli against `schemas/runbook-summary.schema.json`
- **Error Handling**: Typed exit codes (101-105), structured failure cards, transient failure retry logic
- **Shared Artifacts Module**: `orchestration/lib/expected_artifacts.mjs` provides single source of truth for artifact expectations across runbook and CVF
- **Node Version Constraint**: Package.json enforces Node.js v20.x for consistency

### ‚ùå Gaps (to Full Autonomy)

- ‚úÖ ~~No brief‚ÜíAUV compiler~~ (Phase 2 completed)
- ‚úÖ ~~No DAG runner~~ (Phase 3 completed)
- ‚úÖ ~~No runtime MCP router~~ (Phase 4 completed with full schema validation)
- No autonomous code build lane/PR flow (Phase 5 - next)
- Partial CI gates (security/visual) (Phase 6)
- No packaging/report module (Phase 7)
- No durable workflow backend (Phase 8)

### üìù Note on Documentation

- Deleted `docs/phase1_correction.md` as Phase 1 is now complete and corrections have been applied
- `docs/phase_chat.md` is a working document for ongoing phase tracking (not part of formal documentation)

---

## Phase 1: Foundation Hardening & Reliability ‚úÖ COMPLETED (2025-09-06)

## Why This Version Is Better

- Maps each phase ‚Üí files ‚Üí CI ‚Üí proofs so nothing is "hand-wavy"
- Uses your current repo truths (autopilot, capabilities, CVF, hooks) rather than generic agent talk
- Keeps the end game squarely on Upwork-style, multi-AUV deliveries with evidence, packaging, and budgets
